To make the reset happen as soon as the time crosses the reset period boundary, instead of waiting for the next request, you need to update your logic to track the exact reset period and reset the rate limit when that period arrives (even if no new requests are made).

Problem:

Currently, the rate limit is being reset only when a request occurs. This means the reset happens on the next request after the reset period. However, you want the rate limits to reset immediately when the reset period boundary is crossed, regardless of whether a request occurs.

Solution:

To reset the rate limit exactly at the boundary of the reset period (e.g., every 1 minute) and not wait for the next request, we need to update the timestamp logic so that the reset time is checked and handled immediately when the period ends.

Updated Approach:

1. Track the reset time accurately: Ensure that the reset time is calculated based on the current time, not just the next request. You can calculate the next reset time by using DateTime.UtcNow and adjusting it to the correct boundary (e.g., the start of the next minute).


2. Immediate reset if the time has crossed the boundary: When the current time (DateTime.UtcNow) crosses the reset boundary (e.g., 1 minute), reset the counter values immediately.



Adjustments in Code:

Here’s how you can modify your logic to achieve the desired behavior:

1. Calculate the Next Reset Time:

When determining the reset time, calculate the boundary where the reset should happen and store this as the next reset time.

You should use DateTime.UtcNow to calculate when the reset should occur next, and compare it to the commonResetTime to determine if it's time to reset.



2. Reset the counters as soon as the boundary crosses:

If the commonResetTime has passed, reset the counters immediately.

You should not wait for the next request to reset the counters.




Example Code:

Here’s an updated version of your ApplyRateLimit method:

private async Task ApplyRateLimit(HttpContext context, ClientRequestIdentity identity, List<RateLimitRule> rules, string methodEndpoint, bool isBurstLimit)
{
    methodEndpoint = char.ToUpper(methodEndpoint[0]) + methodEndpoint.Substring(1);

    if (isBurstLimit)
    {
        string period = "1m";
        var remainingLimits = new Dictionary<string, int>();
        var resetTimes = new Dictionary<string, string>();
        DateTime commonResetTime;

        // Determine the reset cache key for the client
        var resetCacheKey = $"ResetTime:{identity.ClientId.Split('_')[0]}";

        var cachedResetTime = await this.counterStore.GetAsync(resetCacheKey, context.RequestAborted);
        if (cachedResetTime.HasValue)
        {
            commonResetTime = cachedResetTime.Value.Timestamp;
        }
        else
        {
            // Set the initial reset time as 1 minute from now
            commonResetTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(1);
            await this.counterStore.SetAsync(resetCacheKey, new RateLimitCounter { Timestamp = commonResetTime, Count = 0 }, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
        }

        var tempRemainingLimits = new Dictionary<string, int>();
        var tempResetTimes = new Dictionary<string, string>();

        foreach (var rule in rules)
        {
            var counterId = this.BuildCounterKey1(identity, rule);
            var counter = await this.counterStore.GetAsync(counterId, context.RequestAborted).ConfigureAwait(false);

            if (!counter.HasValue)
            {
                counter = new RateLimitCounter { Timestamp = commonResetTime, Count = 0 };
            }

            // Reset the counter immediately if the current time has passed the reset time
            if (DateTime.UtcNow >= commonResetTime)
            {
                // Reset the counter and set the timestamp to the next reset boundary
                counter = new RateLimitCounter
                {
                    Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(1), // Set the next reset time
                    Count = 0,
                };

                // Store the new reset time and counter
                await this.counterStore.SetAsync(counterId, counter, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
            }
            else
            {
                // Increment the counter if still within the current reset period
                counter = new RateLimitCounter
                {
                    Timestamp = counter.Value.Timestamp,
                    Count = counter.Value.Count + 1,
                };

                // Store the updated counter
                await this.counterStore.SetAsync(counterId, counter, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
            }

            // Calculate remaining limits
            double remaining = rule.Limit - counter.Value.Count;
            tempResetTimes[rule.Endpoint] = commonResetTime.ToString("o");
            tempRemainingLimits[rule.Endpoint] = (int)Math.Max(0, remaining);

            if (string.Equals(rule.Endpoint, methodEndpoint, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            {
                period = rule.Period;
            }
        }

        // Ensure the reset time and remaining limits are added to headers
        foreach (var rule in rules)
        {
            var ruleCounterId = this.BuildCounterKey1(identity, rule);
            var ruleCounter = await this.counterStore.GetAsync(ruleCounterId, context.RequestAborted).ConfigureAwait(false);

            if (!ruleCounter.HasValue)
            {
                ruleCounter = new RateLimitCounter { Timestamp = commonResetTime, Count = 0 };
            }

            resetTimes[rule.Endpoint] = tempResetTimes[methodEndpoint];
            remainingLimits[rule.Endpoint] = (int)Math.Max(0, rule.Limit - ruleCounter.Value.Count);
        }

        const string headerLimit = "X-Burst-Limit-Limit";
        const string headerRemaining = "X-Burst-Limit-Remaining";
        const string headerReset = "X-Burst-Limit-Reset";

        this.AddHeader(headerLimit, period);
        this.AddHeader(headerRemaining, string.Join(", ", remainingLimits.Select(kv => $"{kv.Key}={kv.Value}")));
        this.AddHeader(headerReset, string.Join(", ", resetTimes.Select(kv => $"{kv.Key}={kv.Value}")));
    }
}

Key Changes:

1. Immediate Reset on Boundary Cross:

The key part here is the condition if (DateTime.UtcNow >= commonResetTime), which immediately resets the counters once the time has crossed the reset period boundary.

It updates the timestamp to the next reset period (e.g., adds 1 minute) and resets the counter count to 0.



2. Store the Updated Counter with the New Reset Time:

After resetting the counter, the new reset time is set to DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(1) to track the next reset period accurately.



3. Remaining Limits and Headers:

The remaining limits are calculated based on the updated counter, and the correct reset time is included in the response headers.




Expected Output:

If you make requests continuously before the reset period, the remaining limits will decrease as expected. However, once the 1-minute period ends, the counters will reset immediately at the boundary and the remaining limits will reset accordingly.

After the reset period (1 minute), the response headers will show something like:

X-Burst-Limit-Limit: 1m
X-Burst-Limit-Remaining: create=20, write=20, delete=20, read=20
X-Burst-Limit-Reset: create=2025-02-22T10:03:00Z, write=2025-02-22T10:03:00Z, delete=2025-02-22T10:03:00Z, read=2025-02-22T10:03:00Z

This ensures that as soon as the time crosses the reset boundary, the limit counters are reset without waiting for the next request.
